# Sushi Game

The final assignment for COMP 401, Foundations of Programming. 
Using code built up through previous assignments, I utilized GUI with 
JSwing and internal functionality with Java to create a final game. 

Players can customize color of plate, type of sushi, price of sushi, etc. 
to find the cheapest combination possible. 

Main Concepts used:
* Model View Controller (MVC)
* Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Observer/ Observable
* Inheritance
* Interfaces
* Other programming concepts and fundamentals
